Goddard, named after Robert Goddard, the "Father of Modern Rocketry" and a WPI
alumnus, is a media streaming application (client and server).  Goddard is
designed based on the behaviors of Real Networks streaming media and Windows
Stream media, as observed in measurements studies [1] and [2], respectively.
The Goddard streaming client and server use packet-pairs [3,4,5] to estimate
the bottleneck capacity and select an appropriate media encoding level before
streaming.  During streaming, Goddard client (Gplayer) and server re-select
the media to stream (i.e., perform media scaling) in response to network
packet losses or re-buffering events that occur when the client playout buffer
empties.  Goddard also simulates frame playout of the received media at the
client, allowing frame rate and jitter to be measured for performance
evaluation.  For details on the Goddard design, refer to [6].

The following directories contain the Goddard C++ and OTcl source files and an
Goddard simulation example.

  ns-2.2x/tcl/goddard/ex/

The actual Goddard server and client is implemented in C++, where the Goddard
simulation setup helper object (GodardStreaming Class) is implemented in OTcl
space.  Refer to "ns-2.2x/tcl/goddard/ex/test-goddard.tcl" to see how the
helper object is used.  "ns-2.2x/tcl/goddard/goddard-default.tcl" contains the
default Goddard parameter values.

Have fun.
